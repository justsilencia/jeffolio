                    CSS is definitely one of my sharper tools. Before endulging in the comforts
                    of bootstrap and SASS / LESS, I used pure CSS for a few years, designing
                    everything from responsive navigation menus and layouts to custom
                    forms and buttons. It's a fine thing to watch simple markup come to life
                    with a little CSS.
