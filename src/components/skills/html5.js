                    Although HTML is probably the easiest language to learn in the 
                    multidimensional world of webdev, I love taking simple markup and
                    turning it into a beautiful website.

                    I have a very thorough understanding of HTML (and JSX). From ancient 
                    &lt;frameset&gt; tags to modern HTML5 web standards, I've been acquainted
                    with much of what HTML has had to offer over the years. I've also studied
                    and successfully implemented many modern SEO techniques.
