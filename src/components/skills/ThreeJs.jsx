          After first coming across ThreeJs, I felt strongly that this tech will
          be a huge part of the future of web development. Although it takes
          some finesse to get it right, integrating 3d into a website makes for
          an amazing user experience.

          I plan on continuing to advance my skills with ThreeJs, and 3d models
          in general. The prospect of integrating 3d into web apps is an
          exciting prospect, and my goal is to ensure that I'm ahead of the
          curve.
