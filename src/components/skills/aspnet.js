                    My experience with ASP.NET started with .net version 4 (web forms) 
                    in 2013-ish. Although many agree that web forms wasn't the greatest 
                    framework, I included it here to emphasize that I do have a good 
                    deal of experience working on the Microsoft platform. I've developed
                    3 dynamic websites with this tech, using a SQL server 2014 back-end.

                    I did tinker with MVC a bit, which is much closer conceptually to the 
                    more modern frameworks I use now. However, at that point Nodejs was
                    demanding most of my attention.
