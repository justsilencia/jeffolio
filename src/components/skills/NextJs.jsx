          Like most new techs, I took a project oriented approach to learning
          Next. I wanted to start getting a feel for Web3 development, so I used
          NextJs to build a prototype for a cryptocurrency based startup idea
          that I was toying around with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although this project never made it to completion, I learned a lot
          about NextJs and how to use it to build performant web apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I think NextJs is a great framework for SSR or SSG React
          apps, and I feel very comfortable developing with this framework.
