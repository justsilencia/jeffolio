          I've built quite a few projects using Gatsby, including this
          portfolio. I have found that combining Gatsby with ThreeJs makes for
          an interesting combination. The mixture of SSG and 3d models allows
          for responsive sites with very rich design, and I plan on
          experimenting further with this combo in the future.

          Overall, I'm adept at using Gatsby for achieving great UX and
          performant SEO.
